# if else and elif are the multiway  descision taken by our program due to certain conditions in our code 

#This is the best example of Conditional expression (if n else) 

#         Club Entry:
Bouncer=print("What's your Age:")
Age=int(input("My age is : "))

if(Age>=21):
  print("You are good to go sir🙇")
  print("Have a marvelous night sir 🙇‍♂️")

elif(Age<=0):
  print("B***H, This ain't funny 💢🤬 ")

elif(Age>=60):
  print("This way sir🙇")

else:
  print("What you think, Moron💢 ")
  print("GET the F**k out of here🤬 ")


# There can be as many if and elif statements as you want, but only if statements can stand alone. elif and else must always follow an if.
