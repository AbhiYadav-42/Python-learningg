# Solving a problem by creating is one of the most popular approches in programming.THis is called aboject-oriented programming (OOPS)

#             CLASS
# A class is a blueprint for creating object


#             OBJECT
# Object is an instantiation of class. When class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after instantiation
